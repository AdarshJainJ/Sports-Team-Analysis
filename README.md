# Sports-Team-Analysis

Project Overview:

This project demonstrates the application of Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques on real-world datasets. The goal is to train and test fundamental statistical and EDA concepts commonly used in the industry today. This work emphasizes uncovering insights from raw data through rigorous analysis and visualization, enabling data-driven decision-making for business success.

Problem Statement:

1. Part A: Concept-Based Statistical Analysis

The dataset contains the ages of customers who ordered electric scooters. The challenge is to apply descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the data and derive meaningful insights. Tasks included determining measures of central tendency, variability, skewness, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing.
Key focus: Comparing theoretical statistical techniques with practical observations to make data-informed decisions.

2. Part B: Dataset-Based Basketball Analysis

A basketball dataset includes performance metrics of teams from past tournaments. The task involves cleaning and analyzing the data to recommend which teams the management should invest in to ensure optimal business growth.
Key focus: Identifying the best-performing teams, understanding trends, and building recommendations based on data patterns.

Methods and Techniques
Part A: Concept-Based Statistical Analysis

1. Descriptive Statistics
   Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, skewness, and IQR.
   
2. Visualization
   Boxplots, histograms, and probability distributions for data interpretation.
   
3. Inferential Statistics
   Hypothesis testing using z-tests, t-tests, and chi-square tests.
   Confidence intervals for population parameters.

4. Probability and Distribution Analysis
   Binomial and normal distribution analysis for customer age insights.

5. Central Limit Theorem Verification
   Sampling distributions to validate the CLT.

Part B: Dataset-Based Basketball EDA

1. Data Cleaning
   Handling missing values, ensuring consistency, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
   
2. Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis
   Analyzing key performance metrics like games played, won, drawn, lost, baskets scored/conceded, and tournament history.

3. Feature Engineering
   Creating derived features like win rates, average baskets per game, and launch year comparisons.

4. Visualization
   Bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps for performance comparisons.

5. Statistical Insights
   Identifying the best-performing team, the oldest team, and potential teams for collaboration.

6. Recommendations
   Suggestions to management based on team performance and trends.

Results and Insights:

1. Customer Age Analysis (Part A)
   Key demographic insights about electric scooter customers.
   Statistical evaluation of customer complaints and recommendations for Zen Automotives based on data.

2. Basketball Team Performance (Part B)
   Identified top-performing teams and underperformers.
   Proposed strategic investments in teams with potential to boost organizational growth.

Tools and Libraries:

Python: Data manipulation and statistical analysis.

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.

Statistical Methods: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, descriptive measures.

Visualization: Interactive and static plots for EDA.

Business Impact:

Enhanced decision-making for investments in basketball teams.

Recommendations for improving the quality and accuracy of collected data for future analyses.

Conclusion:
This project bridges theoretical statistics and practical data science. The outcomes showcase the importance of statistical rigor and EDA in extracting actionable insights and aiding businesses in making informed decisions.
